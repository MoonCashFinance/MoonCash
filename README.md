What is MoonCash?

The goal of the MoonCash protocol is to create a decentralized, censorship resistant reserve currency for the emerging Web3 ecosystem. Developing a reserve currency is important because a fundamental goal of the Web3 financial movement is to foster an alternative economic ecosystem that serves the needs of its various stakeholders, which include:

- Having access to unique purpose-built assets that are widely and uniformly available across L1s and L2s
- Being able to transact/store value in highly decentralized and censorship-resistant assets that are not dependent on the traditional financial ecosystem for validation or survival

What is CASH?

MoonCash’s goal is to create a credibly neutral currency for Web3 and to help onboard users into a decentralized, democratized economy, with the additional goal of becoming the reserve currency for DeFi and securing payments accross international borders.

What are reserve currencies designed to achieve?

- Preserving purchasing power: Over the medium- to long-term the asset grows to out-pace inflation, and becomes more stable over time
- Deep liquidity: Reserve currencies are highly liquid and can be easily exchanged for other assets, products and services
- Utilized as a unit of account: Other assets are denominated in the currency
- Reserve assets serve as trusted backing: The currency is viewed as reliable and relatively low risk, which encourages entities to hold large quantities of it in reserve

Why is there a need for a reserve currency in DeFi?

In contrast to the incumbent fiat system that’s declining in value due to inflation, our goal is to build and retain real purchasing power that withstands the test of time. MoonCash’s efforts in Treasury management, development of on-chain governance structures and prudent use of MoonCash’s liquidity and Treasury assets will help to strengthen CASH’s stability.

Who created MoonCash?
